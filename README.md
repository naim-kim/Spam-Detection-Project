## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam). The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Kaggle SMS Spam Collection Dataset.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-detection-project.git
   cd spam-detection-project
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate        # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data/raw/` directory.**

## Usage

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  Run the data preprocessing script to clean and preprocess the raw data.
  ```sh
  python src/data_preprocessing.py
  ```

- **Model Training:**
  Run the model training script to train the Naive Bayes classifier.
  ```sh
  python src/model_training.py
  ```

- **Model Evaluation:**
  Run the model evaluation script to evaluate the trained model.
  ```sh
  python src/model_evaluation.py
  ```

- **Jupyter Notebooks:**
  Alternatively, you can explore the Jupyter notebooks for an interactive analysis and model training:
  - `notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb`
  - `notebooks/model_training.ipynb`
  - `notebooks/model_evaluation.ipynb`
